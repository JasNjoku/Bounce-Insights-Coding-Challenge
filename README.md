<h2>Installation</h2>
To use the application, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal: 

<code>git clone https://github.com/JasNjoku/Bounce-Insights-Coding-Challenge.git</code>


Once the repository has been cloned, navigate to the project directory, and install the required dependencies in both the client folder and the server folder using the following command:

<code>cd client</code>

<code>npm install</code>

<code>cd..</code>

<code>cd server</code>

<code>npm install</code>

## Usage

To use the application, you need to start both the server and client. To start the server, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

<code>node server.js</code>

Or, if you have nodemon installed, you can use the following command to start the server:

<code>nodemon server.js</code>

The server will be running on port 4000.

To start the client, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
<code>npm start</code>

The client will be running on port 3000.

Once both the server and client are running, you can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.
